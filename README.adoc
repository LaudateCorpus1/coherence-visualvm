= Coherence VisualVM Plugin

The Coherence-VisualVM Plugin (the Plugin) provides management and monitoring of a single Coherence cluster using the VisualVM management utility.

The Plugin aggregates Coherence MBean data and shows a concise operational view of a single Coherence cluster.
Some management information is presented over time, which allows real-time analysis and troubleshooting.
You can connect to clusters via JMX or via management over REST with Coherence versions 14.1.1 or above.

The Plugin is an ideal tool for monitoring and managing Coherence clusters during the development and testing lifecycle and supports connecting to both
Community Edition and open source versions of Coherence.

NOTE: This version of the Plugin requires VisualVM release 2.0.4 or later which is available from https://visualvm.github.io/.

== Supported Coherence Versions

The Plugin will connect to and display data for the following Coherence versions:

**Community Editions**: 14.1.1.0.x, 20.06, 20.06.1

**Commercial Editions**: 12.2.1.5.x,  12.2.1.4.x, 12.1.3.x, 12.1.2.x and 3.7.1.x

NOTE: If you wish to connect to Coherence version 12.2.1.4.x via REST you should have Coherence version 12.2.1.4.7 or greater.

== Installing the Plugin from VisualVM

The Coherence VisualVM Plugin is available from the list of plugins in VisualVM versions 2.0.4 and above.

To install the Plugin carry out the following:

1. Choose `Tools` -> `Plugins` from the main menu.
2. In the `Available Plugins` tab, select the Install checkbox for the `VisualVM-Coherence`. Click Install.
3. Step through and complete the plugin installer.

For more information about using the Coherence VisualVM plugin see the official https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/standalone/coherence/14.1.1.0/manage/using-jmx-manage-oracle-coherence.html[Coherence Documentation].

* https://github.com/oracle/coherence-operator[The Coherence Operator - Run your clusters in Kubernetes]

Read on if you want to build the Plugin manually.

== Connecting to a Coherence Cluster

Once the Plugin is installed, you can double-click to a Coherence process, usually
`com.tangosol.net.DefaultCacheServer`, and the `Coherence` tab is displayed.

You can also connect via Coherence Management over REST by right-clicking on the
`Coherence Clusters` tree item and choose `Add Coherence Cluster`. See the https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/standalone/coherence/14.1.1.0/manage/using-jmx-manage-oracle-coherence.html#GUID-9A5B5F14-26A6-49CF-8C0C-3533A5DFB9C6[Coherence Documentation]
for more information on connecting via REST.


== Changing the Plugin Behaviour via System Properties

There are a number of properties that change the behaviour of the Plugin. To pass these properties
to VisvualVM you have to use the `-J` option. For example to change the refresh time from the default
of 30 seconds, you can do the following:

[source,shell]
----
$ visualvm -J-Dcoherence.plugin.visualvm.refreshtime=10
----

The following table outlines all the available properties and their use.

.Table Coherence VisualVM Properties
!===
|Property | Default | Usage
| coherence.plugin.visualvm.refreshtime| 30 |  Time (in seconds) between refreshing data from the cluster. Do not set too low as this could adversely affect performance in large clusters
| coherence.plugin.visualvm.log.query.times| false | Enables logging of query times when retrieving data
| coherence.plugin.visualvm.sorting.enabled | true | Enables JTable sorting
| coherence.plugin.visualvm.heatmap.enabled | false | Enables experimental heat map in Caches tab
| coherence.plugin.visualvm.persistence.list | true | Enables dropdown list of snapshots when performing snapshot operations
| coherence.plugin.visualvm.zoom.enabled | false | Enables additional zoom function for all graphs
| coherence.plugin.visualvm.rest.request.timeout | 30000 | The request timeout (in ms) when using REST to connect to a cluster
| coherence.plugin.visualvm.disable.mbean.check | false | Disables the MBean check when connecting to WebLogic Server
!===

NOTE: If you have used older versions of the Coherence VisualVM plugin available with Coherence, you should
ensure you are using the new property names above.

== Building the Plugin

If you wish to build the Plugin from scratch you need to build the VisualVM dependencies first.
To build the plugin is a two step process:

1. Generate the VisualVM dependencies
2. Build the Coherence VisualVM Plugin

=== Pre-requisites

You must have the following:

1. Java JDK 1.8 - To build VisualVM dependencies
2. Java JDK 11+ - To build and test the plugin
3. Ant version >= 1.9.9
4. Maven 3.6.3+
5. Git

=== Clone the Repository

1. Clone the Coherence VisualVM repository
+
[source,shell]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/oracle/coherence-visualvm.git
----

=== Generate the VisualVM dependencies

NOTE: These instructions have been summarized from https://github.com/oracle/visualvm/blob/release204/README.md.

NOTE: A Script `install-artifacts.sh` is available in the `bin` directory to run this for a Linux/Mac environment.

1. Ensure you have JDK8 in you PATH.

1. Checkout the VisualVM repository
+
[source,shell]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/oracle/visualvm.git

Cloning into 'visualvm'...
----

1. Checkout the `release204` branch
+
[source,shell]
----
$ cd visualvm

$ git checkout release204

Switched to a new branch 'release204'
----

1. Unzip the NetBeans Platform 11.3
+
[source,shell]
----
$ cd visualvm

$ unzip nb113_platform_19062020.zip
----

1. Build the Plugins
+
[source,shell]
----
$ ant build-zip
----

1. Unzip the artefacts
+
[source,shell]
----
$ cd dist

$ unzip visualvm.zip

$ cd ..
----

1. Generate the NBM's
+
[source,shell]
----
$ ant nbms
----

1. Install into the local repository
+
[source,shell]
----
$ mvn -DnetbeansInstallDirectory=dist/visualvm   \
    -DnetbeansNbmDirectory=build/updates   \
    -DgroupIdPrefix=org.graalvm.visualvm  \
    -DforcedVersion=RELEASE204 org.apache.netbeans.utilities:nb-repository-plugin:populate
----

NOTE: See https://github.com/oracle/visualvm/blob/release204/README.md[here] for instructions on how to
push the artefacts to a remote Maven repository.

==== Build the VisualVM Plugin

1. Ensure you have JDK11 or above in your PATH.

1. Build the Plugin
+
From the `coherence-visualvm` directory:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ mvn clean install -DskipTests
----
+
If you wish to run the Community Edition tests then leave out the `-DskipTests`.

1. Install the Plugin
+
The plugin will be available in the location `coherence-visualvm-plugin/target/coherence-visualvm-plugin-{version}`

Follow the instructions https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/standalone/coherence/14.1.1.0/manage/using-jmx-manage-oracle-coherence.html[here]
to install the plugin manually.
